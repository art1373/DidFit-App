## DidFit App

Emphasized on clean code, component-based project, and separations of concerns using Container-Component pattern.

## Dependencies

`Formik && Yup` for our forms and validation
`rn-image-slider-box` although I could implement this myself due to my time and the deadline I mainly used packages like these
`react-navigation` I used version 4 because It was complete with less bugs.
`reduxsauce` simple and redux utility tool
