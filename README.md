## Vation App

Emphsized on clean code, component based project and seperations of concers using
Contianer-Component pattern.

## Dependencies

`Formik && Yup` for our forms and validation
`rn-image-slider-box` althoug I could implement this myself due to the my time and deadline I mainly used packages like these
`react-navigation` I used version 4 due to the fact that It was compelete and less bug
`reduxsauce` simple and redux ulity tool

## issues

- seems like `firebase` auth has an issue where its not catching errors if the user exists so I could not work it out as it was proably the library issue
- Could not adjust the slider due to my busy tasks at my remote job sorry bout that 🙋🏻‍♂️
